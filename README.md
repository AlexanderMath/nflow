PyTorch interface that allows training realnvp, glow, flow++ and iresnet. 

    python main.py --model realnvp
    python main.py --model glow
    python main.py --model flowpp
    python main.py --model iresnet

Updates to come. 
Should work with PyTorch 1.3.1 and 1.4.0. 
RealNVP, Glow and Flow++ was written by <a href="https://github.com/chrischute/">Chris Chute</a>, I just wrote a wrapper around his repositories.
